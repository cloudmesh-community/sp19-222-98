# Project title missing sp19-222-92

This project will take Indiana University Women's soccer players heart rate, how much distance they have sprinted, how fast, 
total distance, number of accelerations calories, and recovery time to determine their positions on the field. Typically a 
goalie will not run as much distance as the other players in this case the player that has the least amount of distance will 
be the goalie and this will follow the same suit for the rest of the players. Based off the data set this AI will determine 
which position the player plays using the k-means machine learning method. The k-means machine learning algorithm will cluster 
data by separating it into groups of equal variance. This Machine algorithm will work best for this because we are trying to 
group them to see which position the players play, which is simply a classifier.  We can use playersâ€™ heart rates and gps data 
to determine what position the person plays. For example we know that if a player has a specific heart rate then he most 
likely plays that position. This algorithm can set the standard of what it takes to play each position. It would allow coaches 
and players both use their data to make improvements on the field.
